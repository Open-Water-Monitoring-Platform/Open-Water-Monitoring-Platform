# Open-Water-Monitoring-Platform

Saafwater was created as a Call for Code submission that won the top prize in the 2021 Call For Code Global Challenge. We are thrilled to contribute our open-source core, the Open Water Monitoring System, to the Linux Foundation. This initiative is all about democratizing access to real-time water quality monitoring technology, empowering communities, researchers, and organizations worldwide to both benefit from and contribute to its development.

The mission of the Open Water Monitoring System is to safeguard public health and ecosystems by providing real-time information on water quality. Our system offers comprehensive data management and allows users to monitor contamination in real-time. By sharing our technology, we hope to empower individuals to implement effective water quality management practices, protect vital water resources, and promote environmental sustainability.

Imagine being able to monitor the water quality of a lake in your neighborhood, ensuring it remains safe for families and wildlife. Or think about a local pond or river â€“ our system can help you keep an eye on potential contaminants and alert you to any changes that might harm the environment. Groundwater is another critical resource, and with our technology, you can track its purity and detect any pollutants that may seep in over time.

This isn't just about technology; it's about involving the community. When people can monitor their water, it creates a deeper connection between them and their environment. It's about taking ownership and responsibility for our shared resources. Our open-source platform allows communities to come together, share data, and work collaboratively to protect their local water sources.

Improved by pilot programs in diverse regions such as Goa and Telangana in India, we envision the Open Water Monitoring System becoming a pivotal tool in tackling water pollution challenges worldwide. By fostering collaboration and innovation, we aim to create a cleaner, safer future for all.

We are young, we create the future, because the world is one family, so let's ensure we safeguard our waters too! Join us in making a difference and protecting our most precious resource. Let's connect with our environment and each other to build a sustainable world.
